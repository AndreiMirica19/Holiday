Mobile application where you can store your trips.
Built an android app using java that  keeps track of user's past holidays.The user can add a new trip completing a form that contains  details about the trip such as the start date, the end date, budget, rating, trip category(Mountain ,City Break or Seaside).On the main page of the app, all the trips are displayed and there is the possibility of adding trips to the bookmark list.All the trips are saved in a Room database.
